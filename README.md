# EfficiencyMax-Intelligent-Order-Allocation-and-Clustering-System

o	Implemented an automation task to cluster similar products using Gaussian Mixture Models which reduced the number of unique products processed by 20% resulting in a substantial decrease in the workers overall processing time by 1.5 hrs. Designed a user-friendly frontend interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing team members to input their daily workload.            
o	Developed a robust backend system using Flask and Python, integrating the GMM algorithm to perform advanced clustering on orders. Orchestrated the entire architecture of the project, from frontend to backend implementation, and deployed the service in GCP.
